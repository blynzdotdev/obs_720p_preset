# obs_720p_preset
Forked from my Private Repo (EDITED& IMPROVED)

720p preset for OBS. 

download the files, both the normal file and the .json and go into `AppData\Roaming\obs-studio\basic\profiles\ ` then creat a new file named `github` then open it and 
drop these to files into it, and you should be good to go

if the you name the folder any other name you should change the name of the profile in the code in the .ini too (2nd line in that)
